1. JSX is not html inside JS. It's HTML like syntax (or XML like).
2. JSX is transpiled before it reached the browser by Babel (managed by Parcel) 
3. JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement - JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
4. Components composition -> Components inside components
5. JSX sanitizes the code that we pass inside {}, preventing XSS attacks.
