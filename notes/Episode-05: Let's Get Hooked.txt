1. There are two types of export - default and named
2. React (and all the other frameworks) are trying to solve the problem of keeping the data and UI layer in sync.
3. React Hooks are normal JS utility functions.
4. Whenever a state variable updates, React re-renders the component.
5. react makes DOM operations super fast and efficient. React is only good at DOM manipulation.
6. React does efficient DOM manipulation because it has a virtual DOM. That is why it is so fast.
7. React Fiber
  a. React uses a reconciliation algorithm, called React Fiber (introduced in React 16).
  b. Virtual DOM is representation of an actual DOM (The React elements that look like JS objects are Virtual DOMs).
  c. Diff algorithm finds the difference between the updated virtual DOM and the previous virtual DOM.
  d. After getting the difference, the actual DOM will be updated.
  e. React Fiber is the new way of finding the diff and updating the DOM.
  f. This is faster as finding out the difference between two JS objects is faster than finding out the difference between HTML code.
  e. React does not touches the actual DOM a lot, thus it is fast.
  f. React uses incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
  g. The concept of Virtual DOM  has existed since a long time, before React.
